# Multiplayer Game

This project started off as a game for me and my friends to play with. We had lots of fun because of the names that we put, trying to crash the server, and more. I didn't know how to make a multiplayer game, so I found this tutorial. This is the link on how to make the game. <a href="https://engineering.paiza.io/entry/paizacloud_online_multiplayer_game">Click here</a>
